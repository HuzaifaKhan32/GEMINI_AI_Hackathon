### Prompt:
```text
/sp.implement 

Start with Phase 1: Design Implementation

Specific instructions:
1. Read ALL design files from /design/stitch_ai_robotics_book_homepage/ (3 folders)
2. Start with the Docusaurus project setup and homepage
3. Follow the design-implementation-plan.md exactly
4. Use TypeScript for all React components
5. Create reusable components in src/components/
6. Apply custom CSS in src/css/custom.css
7. Test after each major component is created

Focus ONLY on Phase 1 (Design Implementation) for now. 
After Phase 1 is complete, I will review before moving to Phase 2.

Begin implementation.
```

### Response:
```text
